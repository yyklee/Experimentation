# Experimentations & Causal Inference

## A/B Testing Project

**[Health Care App Message Optimization](https://github.com/yyklee/social-event-experimentation):**
The project's goal is to optimize the sign-up process for a health care app targeted at socially avoidant individuals. A/B testing is used to experiment with different message types and event presentations on the sign-up page to positively influence users' emotional state and improve participation rates.

## Statistics for Experiments
**[Behavioral Experiments with R](https://github.com/yyklee/R-for-behavioral-experimentations):**
I have organized R syntax for Research Assistants and to help perform various analytical methods, including linear and logistic regression, ANOVA, multi-level modeling, testing for assumptions, and calculating effect sizes.
