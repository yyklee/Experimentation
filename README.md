# Experimentation


## [Healthcare App A/B Testing](https://github.com/yyklee/social-event-experimentation)

Given that the app users are primarily socially avoidant individuals, we recognize the importance of maximizing their participation rates. By incorporating different message types, we aim to influence their emotional state positively and create a more engaging and encouraging sign-up process. To achieve this goal, we decided to use experimentation to find out the optimal lay-out of the page by carefully crafting the messaging and event types presented on the sign-up page ([click here](https://github.com/yyklee/social-event-experimentation))
