# Experimentations & Causal Inference

## Project 1 - [Message Optimization through A/B Testing](https://github.com/yyklee/Health-Care-App-Optimization)
The project's goal is to optimize the sign-up process for a health care app targeted at socially avoidant individuals. A/B testing is used to experiment with different message types and event presentations on the sign-up page to positively influence users' emotional state and improve participation rates.

## Project 2 - [Geo-Experimentation via Time Based Regression](https://github.com/yyklee/R-for-behavioral-experimentations)
Understanding time based regression (TBR) approach to marketing campaign analysis in the context of geo experimentation

## Project 3 - [Behavioral Experiments with R](https://github.com/yyklee/R-for-behavioral-experimentations)
I have organized R syntax for Research Assistants and to help analyze various behavioral science experiments. It includes syntax for linear and logistic regression, ANOVA, multi-level modeling as well as methods to test for assumptions and calculate effect sizes.
