## Experiments & Causal Inference

This section demonstrates how I have learned to design and conduct trustworthy experiments through my time as a research fellow. 

### Project 1 - [Message Optimization through A/B Testing](https://github.com/yyklee/Health-Care-App-Optimization)
The project aims to make signing up for a healthcare app easier for people who are socially avoidant. We're using A/B testing to try out different messages and ways of showing events on the event sign-up page. This is to help users feel better about joining and to enhance the engagement of the app. 

### Project 2 - [Behavioral Experiments with R](https://github.com/yyklee/R-for-behavioral-experimentations)
As a Graduate Research Fellow, I've put together R syntax for Research Assistants, making it easier to analyze different behavioral science experiments. This includes tools for linear and logistic regression, ANOVA, multi-level modeling, testing assumptions, and calculating effect sizes.
